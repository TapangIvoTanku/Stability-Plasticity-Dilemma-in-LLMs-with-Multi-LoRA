For RQ3, which examines the impact of Multi-LoRA (an extension of the Low-Rank Adaptation technique that uses multiple LoRA adaptors) on the plasticity-stability trade-offs in LLMs across Tasks A and B, we'll prepare a README.md. This README will specifically highlight the methodology involving Multi-LoRA adaptation to explore its effects on task performance, model robustness, and computational overhead when adapting to new tasks.

# Multi-LoRA Adaptation in Large Language Models: RQ3 Focus

This repository delves into the adaptation strategies in large language models (LLMs), particularly through the lens of Multi-LoRA, a novel approach employing multiple Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) adaptors to balance the trade-offs between plasticity and stability. The investigation, guided by Research Question 3 (RQ3), aims to assess the efficacy of Multi-LoRA in maintaining high task performance and model robustness while considering the computational overhead.

## Research Question 3

**RQ3**: To what extent does Multi-LoRA demonstrate plasticity-stability trade-offs in LLMs, as evaluated by task performance, model robustness, and computational overhead when adapting to new tasks?

## Hypotheses for RQ3

- **H3a**: Multi-LoRA exhibits a trade-off between plasticity and stability in LLMs when adapting to new tasks. It shows superior task performance or model robustness but requires higher computational overhead.

## Methodology

Utilizing the Multi-LoRA adaptation strategy, the model undergoes a series of adaptations:
1. **Task A Adaptation**: Initially, the model is adapted to Task A using Multi-LoRA, setting the stage for enhanced learning capabilities without significant catastrophic forgetting.
2. **Task B Adaptation**: Building on the adapted model from Task A, Multi-LoRA is further applied to adapt to Task B, aiming to optimize the balance between learning new information and retaining previous knowledge.

## Directory Structure

- **Scripts**:
  - `data_prep.py`: Preparation and processing of datasets for Task A and Task B.
  - `lora_task_B.py`: Application of Multi-LoRA for Task B adaptation, following the adaptation to Task A.
  - `requirements.txt`: Lists all necessary Python package dependencies.

## Installation

Prepare your environment for the experiments by ensuring Python is installed and then install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
```

## Running the Experiments

To adapt to Task A and subsequently to Task B using Multi-LoRA:

```
python scripts/lora_task_B.py
```

## Contributing

Enhancements to the analysis or improvements to the implementation are welcome. Please fork this repository and submit a pull request with your changes.

Let's proceed to create the README.md for RQ3 based on this overview.

It seems there was an issue creating the README.md file for RQ3. Let me try a different approach to ensure you receive the content you need.

I encountered a technical hiccup while creating the README file directly. Instead, I'll provide the content here, so you can easily copy it into your own README.md file for RQ3:
